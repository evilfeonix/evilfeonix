🌐 Harnessing chaos to create order in the digital realm.

I'm a curious student with a passion for exploring the world of ethical hacking and cybersecurity. While I’m just starting out, I’m determined to build my skills and contribute to the fascinating world of digital security.

### 🔎 Interests:

- Gray hat hacking: Finding vulnerabilities and learning how to fix them.
- OSINT (Open-Source Intelligence): Digging into publicly available data for fun and insights.
- Programming: Experimenting with Python, JavaScript, and tools that help secure (or challenge) systems.

### 🎯 What I’m Working On:

- Developing small hacking tools for learning and practice.
- Diving into bug bounty hunting and penetration testing basics.
- Building a portfolio of ethical hacking projects.

### 🚀 Goals:

1. Master the art of recon and vulnerability analysis.
2. Learn how to defend systems as effectively as I can test them.
3. Build a community of like-minded learners and mentors.
